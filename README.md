## How To Run The Application

1. Install all the dependencies as stated.

2. After opening the project on QT Creator application, run the application. The QT Creator should build and then proceed to run the application.

3. QT Creator should have created a build folder under a directory that you have stated, move load-superppr-viz.py into the build folder. As of now, it is impossible to build python and c++ together and hence this hackish move.

4. You can now proceed to upload edge list!
